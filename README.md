# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview
### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis of PyBer is to show the differences in fares between the three different types of city markets: urban, suburban and rural. Analyzing the ride information and fare information in this way can help us to identify any potential changes in strategy that could be made in the different city types in attempt to maximize revenues across all three city types.
## Results
The results of this analysis shows some fairly large differences between PyBer fares in the three different city types, but they all have some similarities in their trends over time despite their differences in volume and overall fare revenue. The Total Fare by City Type line chart, which can be found in the attached Analysis folder, shows large, consistent differences in total fares week to week between the three city types, consistent with what would likely be expected given the differences in usage between the city types.

A summary dataframe can also be found in the attached Resources folder. The Urban city type has the greatest volume/usage for PyBer, as well as the greatest number of drivers and highest total fare revenue in each week analyzed, but it also has the lowest average fares ($24.53 per ride). That trend continues with the Suburban and Rural areas too, where the lower volume/usage and fewer drivers for PyBer correlates to lower total fares, but higher average fares ($30.97 per ride in Suburban areas, $34.62 per ride in Rural areas).

The Urban market has over 80% of PyBer drivers and just under 70% of the total rides, but the other two markets have a greater share of the percentage of rides than they do of the percentage of drivers. The Suburban market has 26% of rides but only 16% of drivers, and the Rural segment has about 5% of rides but only about 2.5% of drivers. The ease of access and the demand in the Urban market contributes to the having the highest total fares each week (the Urban segment makes up more than 60% of PyBer's total fares from January-April), while the scarcity in the other markets lead to higher average fares.
## Summary
From the results of the analysis, a few changes could be made to increase revenues for PyBer across these different city types.
- In the Rural and Suburban areas, where the demand for rides is greater than the supply of drivers, a campaign to add more drivers and increase accessibility could capitalize on the higher average fares, while also potentially increasing demand for rides in those areas as they become more available and more accessible.
- From the line chart, we also see some changes in volume that trend in the same direction across all three city types, such as the increases in volume for all three in the 2nd to last week in February, followed by the decreases in volume for all three the following week. Researching what some of the root causes were for these increases and decreases can lead to optimizing revenues during those weeks when changes in volume might be expected. Was there an event in a nearby city or a holiday weekend that led to more demand for rides with PyBer? Was there inclement weather that made people want to stay in that caused a decrease in demand for rides?
- The Urban market accounts for 68% of PyBer rides, 63% of total fares, but has 81% of the drivers and the lowest average fares. Smoothing out the availability/supply of drivers in the Urban segment to more closely match up with the demand and sort of forcing a bit of driver scarcity could increase the average fares, thus increasing total fare revenue in Urban areas. However it is important not to go too far with scarcity and rising fare prices, as it could lead to losing market share to any potential competitors. Researching the wait times and fare prices that are generally acceptable among the Urban rider population could provide good targets for a driver base and an average ride fare to maximize revenue in the Urban segment while not risking losing market share among the rider population.
